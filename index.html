   <h2>-Brief indruction of Wuthering Heights: It is a English typical and classic novel by Emily Bront(published in 1847 under her pseudonym "Ellis Bell".)This book is also cherrfully 
   a story of love, obsession, hate and revenge.Basically used the style of narration by the characters from the novel of itself. Another way to say, that the novel is not only a purely
   classic novel，it also a pioneering text of the Gothic genre. It feels chaotic human emotions, with realness mixed with themes of death and supernatural events. Even though Wuthering 
   Heights is set entirely within the Romantic period, the values of both the Romantic and Victorian periods are present in the novel. The novel was titled Wuthering Heights because much 
   of the plot takes place at the titular manor. Cathy and Heathcliff grew up there and fall in love as teenager. Cathy and Heathcliff grew up experience.
